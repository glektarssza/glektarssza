# About Me #

Hey there! I'm G'lek and I'm a software developer with a particular passion for
web technologies and video games, specifically modding them.

My main goals are to create software projects that make development easier and
more streamlined for myself, plus to make the I play more enjoyable.

If somebody else happens to find one of the tools or game mods I've created
useful then that's the cherry on top!

If you've found one of my tools or mods useful I'd love to hear about it! Feel
free to drop me a note on the relevant repository, by email, on social media, or
better yet think about throwing a few coins my way! Even a tiny donation can
really motivate the continuation of my work!

All the mods I make will always be free, my way of saying thank you to the
amazing games and their developers that have given me so many hours of joy over
the years. If you find somebody charging for one of my mods, it's not me! Report
it!
